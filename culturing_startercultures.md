# Culturing Protocol: Creating Starter Cultures

These are general procedures.

<b>From frozen glycerol stocks:</b>
- remove glycerol stocks from -80 freezer on ice
- in sterile environment (ideally sterile bench), scrape small amount of material using a sterile pipette tip
- drop pipette tip into vial containing desired media (for reviving frozen cells, a rich medium is generally best) and incubate "overnight"
- <i> usually</i> this "overnight" culture is plated and individual clones/colonies selected and re-grown for further experimentation (see below)
- environmental strains may need more than one night to grow to density

<b>From agar(etc.) plates:</b>
- select colony or colonies to be grown - good practice to circle/dot selected colony with a sharpie on the plastic
- in sterile environment, scrape colony with a sterile inculating loop or sterilized toothpick
- stir loop/toothpick in desired media, then remove and incubate "overnight"
- environmental strains may need more than one night to grow to density
- plates can be sealed with parafilm and stored upside down in a refrigerator for a couple of weeks
