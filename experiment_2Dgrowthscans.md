# General procedure for 2D Growth Scan experiments in 96 well plates

There are many ways to set up these experiments, depending on the desired output and equipment available.
This is the easiest way we've found for a basically manual set up.

Nutrient 1 is varied across the rows (6-8 concentrations)<br>
Nutrient 2 is varied across the columns (10-12 concentrations)

- Nutrient 1 is prepared in background media in the desired concentrations - for 1 plate, ~2mL of each condition is enough.<br>
- Nutrient 2 is prepared in background media in 20X the desired concentrations - for 1 plate, ~100uL of each stock is enough. 

- Nutrient 2 is the added 10uL per 200uL (20X dilution) to each well across the respective columns.<br>
- Nutrient 1 is added 190uL to each well across the respective rows. <br>

Note: A multichannel pipette is handy, as is a liquid handling robot if many replicates are desired.<br>
Working from small to large concentrations, pipette tips can be re-used when adding Nutrient 2 but not when adding Nutrient 1, since tips might touch and contaminate for the already added Nutrient 2.

Note: the working stock concentrations of Nutrient 2 must be adjusted slightly upwards since they will be slightly diluted by the addition of the Nutrient 1 media.
