- 	Na2HPO4*7H20 64g
- KH2PO4 15g
- NaCl 2.5g

Add MilliQ water to 1L volume

Sterilize (autoclave)

For 1L of 1X M9 media base, add 200mL of the 5X salts and 2mL 1M MgSO4 solution to final volume of 1L in sterile milliQ water

Note: this recipe omits CaCl2 to avoid possible precipitation in concentrated nutrient conditions.
